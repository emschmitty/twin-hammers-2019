	<p>Welcome to the <strong>LaCroix Hydration Club</strong>, brought to you by Twin Hammersâ€¦And That Pamplemousse! "What's this all about?" you ask?
	<p>For one, IT'S ABOUT SPIRIT! Any veteran Sunbreaker knows that a key to tourney success is sharing in a super dope Spirit Challenge with opposing teams after each game (they may be opponents on the field but they're friends in our hearts!)</p>
	<p>For another, it's about <strong>taking your hydration seriously!</strong></p>
	<p style="font-size: 2rem; color: blue; text-align: center;">(#TakeYourHydrationSeriously)</p>
	<p>At the heart of the LaCroix Hydration Club&mdash;and our spirit challenge&mdash; is the creation and consumption of the <strong>Rainbow of Hydration</strong>! Spirit Winners begin their journey to total hydration by going on a treasure hunt slash obstacle course. Their goal? To find their very own <strong>Spirit Flavor</strong> (some people have spirit animals; our people have Spirit Flavors). Our Spirit Winners embark on this journey by turning over a disc&mdash;this will unlock their <strong>Flavor Team</strong>.</p>
	<p>The Spirit Winners will search for the LaCroix Hydration Club members that matches their given flavor&mdash;this club member will be their <strong>Flavor Spirit Guide</strong>. The Flavor Spirit Guide will then gift the Spirit Winner with a bottle of flavor&mdash;the first step in creating their Spirit Flavor.</p>
	<p>Now comes the obstacle course! Spirit Winners must first knock down a wall of cans with a disc. When successful, they'll discover the cup in which they will create their Spirit Flavor.</p> 
	<p>Next, Spirit Winners will proceed to locate a can of <strong>Pure LaCroix</strong>, searching for the cherished item in a bucket of empty cans. To make things even more interesting, they must retrieve the can using only their mouths.</p>
	<p><strong>The Spirit Winners are now almost ready to create their very own spirit flavors!</strong></p>
	<p><strong>But first...</strong> They will need to pass a whipped cream flip contest. (Naturally.)</p>
	<p>Once successful, the Spirit Winners will proceed to the finish line where&mdash;at last&mdash;they will <strong>Create and Hydrate</strong> with their very own <strong>LACROIX SPIRIT FLAVOR</strong>.
	<p>Winners will not only be gifted with a goodie bag of hydration-related items, they'll also receive the ultimate prize&mdash;<strong>TOTAL HYDRATION!</strong></p>
