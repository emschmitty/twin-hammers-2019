    <p>This Independence Day weekend, before you get seven on the line, ask yourself this question, "Is my team fully prepared in the thirst department?"</p>
    <p>If there's even the slightest chance that the answer to that is "no," here's some great info on how to win in the water department.</p>
    <h3>The Importance of Taking Your Hydration Seriously</h3>
    <p>We're sure you don't need convincing, but here are the top reasons for paying attention to your H<sup>2</sup>O consumption.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dehydration negatively impacts performance.</strong> Research shows that "During challenging athletic events, it is not uncommon for athletes to lose 6â€“10% of body weight in sweat loss" and that "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908954/" target="_blank">decrements in physical performance</a> in athletes have been observed under much lower levels of dehydration, as little as 2%." If you don't want to suck when you're trying to cup or jam it up the jamhole, replenish your water levels whenever you can.</li>
      <li><strong>Exercising in the heat exacerbates dehydration.</strong> Sunbreak ain't just about running around chasing plastic. It's about doing so in potentially sweltering temperatures&mdash;which makes keeping up on your liquid intake all the more important. After all, as studies suggest, "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17921463" target="_blank">Dehydration during physical activity</a> in the heat provokes greater performance decrements than similar activity in cooler conditions, a difference thought to be due, at least in part, to greater cardiovascular and thermoregulatory strain associated with heat exposure." Your tournament volunteers take your hydration seriously. Your team takes your hydration seriously. You should do the same.</li>
      <li><strong>Hydration supports the body's "cleansing" processes.</strong> As the edwca.org points out, the makeup of <a href="https://www.edwca.org/index.php/hydration/" target="_blank">your liver is almost three-quarters water</a>. And we get the feeling you're going to want to do whatever you can to support your liver this tournament.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feeling convinced that it is indeed time to #TakeYourHydrationSeriously? Here are some ways to do just that.
    <h3>Follow the 1:1 Rule</h3>
    <p>If you're choosing to consume beverages that are not known to be overly hydrating throughout the tournament (ex: coffee), make sure you're following each serving with a big swig of water. For every non-water drink you have, follow it up with a water one.</p>

    <h3>Set Reminders for Yourself and Your Teammates</h3>
    <p>There are all sorts of great smarthphone apps you can download that'll remind you to suck back some of the good stuff regularly throughout the day. Or, you can have whoever is in charge of your team's playlist add a "water song" to the playlist&mdash;to be played at regular intervals&mdash;that reminds your team to chug. This song could by anything, as long as it reminds you to drink some water. We recommend "Waterfalls" by TLC, random water or waterfall sounds, or, of course, "LaCroix Boi" by Big Dipper.</p>

    <h3>Make Your Hydration Game a Fun One By Drinking the Rainbow</h3>
    <p>Take your water game to the next level by downing some sweet, sweet LaCroix. Drinking delicately flavored bubbly is a surefire way to inspire you to get enough H<sup>2</sup>O in your system.</p>
