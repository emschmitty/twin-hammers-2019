    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <br>
    We’re a group of DiscNW Fall Hat rag-tag orphans that came together to form a forever family for Frisbee tournaments
    in and around the PNW.<br>
    <br>
    The core team started back in 2015, attending Hanford Howl as "Marvel's Misfits." We proceeded to attend Hanford and
    Sunbreak nearly every year since. Last year at Sunbreak, we decided to adopt the "Twin Hammers" moniker and we
    haven't looked back since!

                dressed up as "rejected" superheroes such as Captain Canada, Poor Batman, Captain Hindsight, The
                Flasher, and Quail Man. Little did we know that this tournament was just the beginning...

                the amazing children's cartoon, Avatar: The Last Airbender. The weekend featured characters such as
                Korra, Aang, Oppa, and the Cabbage Guy. Our favorite in-game points were cabbage points, which replaced
                the disc with a head of lettuce.

                Pixar film, Toy Story. From the little green aliens to Mr. Potato Head to Mrs. Nesbit (aka Buzz drunk on tea) to Bo Peep and more, we made sure the whole toy gang was thoroughly represented (Woody was there, too, but didn't make it into this photo...). The costume MVP was Slink,
                which was played by 2 players; ducttape operated as Slink's "slinky."

                "Parade of Nations," during which our Captain Hammer got with hit an "Ice Ray" and had to drink an ice-related beverage whilst marching spirit-ably. As a collection of eclectic villains, we took Hanford by force and brought
                the spirit.

                members of the "most inclusive yacht club between the Montlake Cut and the Sixty Acres Sea". Hammers
                were a staple as we soaked up the sun and brought the fun. Check out our <a

                <b>TWIN HAMMERS IKEA - Hanford Howl 2018</b><br><br>We followed up our nautical adventure by paying homage
                to the Swedish megastore, IKEA. It all started when one of our teammates had a burning desire to dress
                up as a chair. Other teammates attended as various items related to the IKEA shopping experience:
                the ubiquitous blue IKEA shopping bag, store employees, customers, cafeteria food (like IKEA’s famous Swedish
                meatballs), and more. The highlight of this theme
                was the spirit game, which had Spirit Winners live out a day in an IKEA store, making their way through an obstacle course while collecting materials to construct their very own IKEA furniture piece&mdash;with only an ambiguous
                instruction manual to guide them. (Yes, one of our teammate's dressed as an instruction manual).
