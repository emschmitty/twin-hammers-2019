<h1>About Us</h1>
<br>
We’re a group of DiscNW Fall Hat rag-tag orphans that came together to form a forever family for Frisbee tournaments in and around the PNW.<br>
<br>
The core team started back in 2015, attending Hanford Howl as "Marvel's Misfits." We proceeded to attend Hanford and Sunbreak nearly every year since. Last year at Sunbreak, we decided to adopt the "Twin Hammers" moniker and we haven't looked back since!

We dressed up as "rejected" superheroes such as Captain Canada, Poor Batman, Captain Hindsight, The Flasher, and Quail Man. Little did we know that this tournament was just the beginning...

            <b>AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER - Sunbreak 2016</b><br><br>The team's first Sunbreak, we decided to go as the amazing children's cartoon, Avatar: The Last Airbender. The weekend featured characters such as Korra, Aang, Oppa, and the Cabbage Guy. Our favorite in-game points were cabbage points, which replaced the disc with a head of lettuce.

            <b>WOODY'S ROUNDUP - Hanford Howl 2016</b><br><br>We decided to followup Hanford as everyone's favorite Pixar film, Toy Story. Complete with the little green aliens, to Mrs. Potato Head, to Mrs. Nesbit (aka - Buzz drunk on tea), to Bo Peep, the team featured everyone but Woody himself. The costume MVP was Slink, which was played by 2 players with a slinky duct taped between them.

During the parade of nations, our Captain Hammer got with hit an Ice ray and had to drink an ice on our wagon during the walk down. A collection of eclectic villains, we took Hanford by force and brought the spirit.

            <b>TWIN HAMMERS IKEA - Hanford Howl 2018</b><br><br>We followed up our nautical adventure paying homage to the Swedish megastore, IKEA. It all started when one of our teammates had a burning desire to dress up as a chair. Other teammates attended as various items related to the IKEA shopping experience (ex: the ubiquitous blue IKEA shopping bag), store employees, customers, foods (ex: IKEA’s famous Swedish meatballs), and the stick figure person featured in the instruction manuals. The highlight of this theme was the spirit game: a day in the IKEA store. Spirit winners were led through an obstacle course race throughout sections of the store to collect materials to construct IKEA furniture from an ambiguous instructions manual.
