    La Croix doesn’t need more evangelists, but we’re going to #preach anyway. After all, with the hot days of summer
    upon us, we want to proclaim to the world that “IT’S TIME TO TAKE YOUR HYDRATION SERIOUSLY!”
    (#TakeYourHydrationSeriously).
    <br><br>
    Twin Hammers... And That Pamplemousse will provide teammates, opponents, and passersby some much needed refreshments
    over at 60 Acres, whether they are all about that #PeachPearDontCare life, want to live their own Tangerine dream,
    are Berry jazzed for Cran-Raz, want a wellness shot of Apricot, or are looking to discover their one true
    Passion(fruit). We’re here to help them (Man)go (Coco)nuts and fuel their lives with Pure bliss.
    <br><br>
    Our half-time and time-out Bubble Bar will introduce interested field attendees to some of the finest artisanal
    mocktails — aka, LaCroixtails (pronounced La-Cwock-Tails) — around, and the post-game Spirit Challenge will feature
    Spirit Winners partaking in a La Croix-based treasure hunt that ends in a boat race to see who can finish all their
    La Croix first. We’ll be crowning a La Croix Roi, if you will. (Fun fact: “Roi” is French for king.)
    <br><br>
    In the spirit of encouraging our fellow tourney goers to take their hydration seriously
    (#TakeYourHydrationSeriously), we’ll be generous with our La Croix stash (though a little friendly bartering may be
    in order)—after all, dehydration is the enemy.
    <br><br>
    All the while, we’ll seek to answer the age-old question, <a href="quiz.html">WHAT FLAVOR OF LACROIX ARE YOU?</a>
