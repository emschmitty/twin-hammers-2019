    LaCroix doesn’t need more evangelists, but we’re going to #preach anyway. After all, with the hot days of summer
    upon us, we want to proclaim to the world that <b>“IT’S TIME TO TAKE YOUR HYDRATION SERIOUSLY!”</b>
    (#TakeYourHydrationSeriously).
    <br><br>
    Twin Hammers... And That Pamplemousse will provide teammates, opponents, and passersby some much needed refreshments
    over at 60 Acres, whether they are all about that #PeachPearDontCare life, want to live their own Tangerine dream,
    are Berry jazzed for Cran-Raz, want a wellness shot of Apricot, or are looking to discover their one true
    Passion(fruit). We’re here to help them (Man)go (Coco)nuts and fuel their lives with Pure bliss.
    <br><br>
    Our half-time and time-out Bubble Bar will introduce interested field attendees to some of the finest artisanal
    mocktails — aka, LaCroixtails (pronounced La-Cwock-Tails) — around, while players feature in a LaCroix based fashion
    show. For the post-game Spirit Challenge, Spirit Champions will attemp to <i>taste the rainbow</i> and embark on a
    flavor adventure to unlock their taste buds. Flavor supplements will be given to several players on Twin Hammers and
    the Spirit Champions must engage in challenges to unlock new flavors. They will then mix their flavors to get the
    ultimate prize - HYDRATION!
    <br><br>
    In the spirit of encouraging our fellow tourney goers to take their hydration seriously
    (#TakeYourHydrationSeriously), we’ll be generous with our La Croix stash (though a little friendly bartering may be
    in order)—after all, dehydration is the enemy.
    <br><br>
    All the while, we’ll seek to answer the age-old question, <a href="quiz.html">WHAT FLAVOR OF LACROIX ARE YOU?</a>
