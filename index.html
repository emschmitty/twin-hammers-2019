    <h2>Why Do We Want to Attend Sunbreak 2019 as a LaCroix-Themed Team?</h2>
    <p>LaCroix doesn’t need more evangelists, but we’re going to #preach anyway. After all, with the hot days of summer upon us, we want to proclaim to the world that <strong>“IT’S TIME TO TAKE YOUR HYDRATION SERIOUSLY!”</strong></p>
    <p style="font-size: 2rem; color: blue; text-align: center;">(#TakeYourHydrationSeriously)</p>
    <p>Twin Hammers...And That Pamplemousse are looking to provide teammates, opponents, and passersby over at 60 Acres some much needed refreshments, whether they are all about that <font color="#FF5733">#PeachPearDontCare</font> life, want to live their own <font color="orange">Tangerine</font> dream,
    are <font color="purple">Berry</font> jazzed for <font color="#FF3374">Cran-Raz</font>, want a wellness shot of <font color="FF7433">Apricot</font>, or are looking to discover their one true <font color="#FC33FF">Passion(fruit)</font>. We’re here to help them <font color="#A5FF33">(Man)go</font> <font color="#949957">(Coco)nuts</font> and fuel their lives with <font color="#3ACCFF">Pure</font> bliss.</p>
    <p>Our half-time and time-out <strong><a href="mocktails.html">Bubble Bar</a></strong> will introduce interested field attendees to some of the finest artisanal mocktails&mdash;aka, LaCroixtails (pronounced "La-Cwock-Tails")&mdash;around. Simultaneously, players can participate in a competitive LaCroixtail-themed fashion show where contestants create new mix-and-match flavors (in the words of <a href="https://youtu.be/LB_YWGuYGn4" target="_blank">Big Dipper</a>, it's all about that "mélange in your mouth") by dressing up a teammate with flavor-inspired gear. Contestants are scored on creativity, flare, and how easy it is to guess the brand new flavor combo. Winners will receive a delightful surprise that'll keep them inspired to take their hydration seriously.</p>
    <p>The fun doesn't stop there! We'll invite the Spirit Winners from each game to participate in our post-game Spirit Challenge during which they'll be presented with an opportunity to <em>drink the rainbow</em>. You can read all about it on our <strong><a href="spirit.html">Spirit Game</a></strong> page.</p>
    <p>In the spirit of encouraging our fellow tourney goers to take their hydration seriously (<strong>#TakeYourHydrationSeriously</strong>), we’ll be generous with our La Croix stash (though a little friendly bartering may be in order)&mdash;after all, <strong>dehydration is the enemy</strong>.</p>
    <p>All the while, we’ll seek to answer the age-old question, <a href="quiz.html">WHAT FLAVOR OF LACROIX ARE YOU?</a></p>
